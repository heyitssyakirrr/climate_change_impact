# 🌍 Climate Change Impact Analysis

A Data Mining project that analyzes historical weather and climate data to investigate the long-term impact of global warming and climate change. 

This repository contains a comprehensive **Jupyter Notebook** that performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling to visualize temperature trends and forecast future climate conditions.

## 📊 Project Overview

Climate change is one of the most critical challenges of our time. This project aims to leverage data mining techniques to:
- Analyze historical temperature anomalies.
- Identify correlations between time periods and rising temperatures.
- Visualize the impact of climate change on specific regions (e.g., France, Ile-de-France).
- Forecast future trends using statistical models.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, formatting dates, and cleaning noise from raw weather datasets.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
    * Visualizing temperature changes over decades.
    * Heatmaps and correlation matrices.
    * Boxplots to detect outliers in weather patterns.
* **Trend Analysis**: Breaking down seasonal vs. annual global warming trends.
* **Predictive Modeling**: (Optional: Mention if you used Linear Regression, ARIMA, or Random Forest here) to predict future temperatures.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language**: Python 3.x
* **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
* **Libraries**:
    * `pandas` & `numpy`: Data manipulation.
    * `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: Data visualization.
    * `scikit-learn`: Machine learning models.
    * `statsmodels` (if used): Time series analysis.
